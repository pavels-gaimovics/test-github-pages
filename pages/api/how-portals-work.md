Hello, friend! I see what you want to become a real website developer rockstar! You even have some knowledge about HTML and CSS. But to be real tough developer you need to know a lot of things too, like how work browsers, how they make requests and what kind of request they can do.

## What is HTTP?

Let's think about it, like we are browser developers like Firefox developers and we want access data from server and show it to user. But Google Chrome developers want to do same thing and now we need unical solution - how both browsers will make requests to server?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for transferring files -- such as text, images, sound, video and other multimedia files -- over the web. As soon as a user opens their web browser, they are indirectly using HTTP. HTTP is an application protocol that runs on top of the TCP/IP suite of protocols, which forms the foundation of the internet. The latest version of HTTP is HTTP/2, which was published in May 2015. It is an alternative to its predecessor, HTTP 1.1, but does not it make obsolete.
